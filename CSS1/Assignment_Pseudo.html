        <span>I'</span>m from a middle-class family of Tamil Nadu, I am Jawahar Sakthi V. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable businessman in our community.

        My mother is a doctor. They both love their occupation. Thatâ€™s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
        
        We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my brothers and sisters. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all are in the same school. Reading is my passion.
        
        I am a keen reader of novels and history books as I have a strong interest in Indian History and classical architecture. I love to read books that refer to the rich history and civilization of ancient India.  At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.
